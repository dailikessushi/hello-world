# This is Daisuke!
## Greetings
Hi there,

This is Daisuke. I am a Nipponese.
I am, if I may say so myself, a PC geek.
But I am a newbie of Github.

I am really interested in Vulkan API now. So I began to learn C++.
And I got a certification for Computer Graphics Engineer, Basic recently.

Everything has only just begun. I am most excited now.

我还在学习汉语。

Best regards,

Daisuke
