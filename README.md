# This is Daisuke!
## Greetings
Hi, everyone!

This is Daisuke. I am, if I may say so myself, a PC geek.
But I am a newbie of Github.

I am really interested in Vulkan API now. So I began to learn C++.
And I got a certification for Computer Graphics Engineer, Basic.

Everything has only just begun. I am most excited now.

best regards
