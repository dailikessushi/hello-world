## ISSUES

   I have two issues.

1. English skill

   I will take more time to create documents because I have to use dictionaries. I don't believe in web translators perfectly to describe them correctly because I have ever had a impolite email from a world-wide company by using one. Therefore speaking in English does not feel as good as writing. However, I complete my job to the last detail.

2. Chronic Disease

   I must confess that I suffer from schizophrenia. I have been fired by my company several times after confessing this to my bosses. So if your corporate culture has prejudice or discrimination, please decline my application. As long as I am taking my medicine, I have no problems. Please consider me positively.
